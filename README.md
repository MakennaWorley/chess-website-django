This was my final project for my Databases class but my final project was done in PHP (you can find it under chess-website-php-DISCONTINUED). After using Django in my Software Engineering class, I have decided to move the code from PHP into Django because of the versatility Django provides. This is the main code that will eventually be used by Oakwood Elementary's Chess Club to both pair and update all the students ratings.
